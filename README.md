# Portfolio - Sports Betting

Welcome to my portfolio, where I present scripts and demo projects developed for sports betting between **2022** and **2024**.  
Over the course of these years, I have continually evolved in crafting software solutions, striving for greater efficiency and cleaner code.  
Reflecting on my journey through approximately 20 projects, there has been a noticeable progression in code quality. Initially, my scripts were large and unwieldy; however, they gradually transformed into more modular structures and ultimately culminated in efficient algorithms.  
This repository is dedicated to showcasing only the most well-crafted and impactful projects from that journey in terms of programming.

## Overview

This repository highlights my work on:
- **Reverse Engineering Sportsbooks**: Analyzing and adapting sportsbook platforms.
- **Browserless Requests**: Creating scripts to interact with websites efficiently without the use of browsers.
- **Anti-Bot Detection**: Developing innovative methods to circumvent anti-bot mechanisms implemented by sportsbooks and popular third-party protections such as Cloudflare.
- **Data Engineering**: Handling data from multiple sportsbooks, each following its own unique structure, and transforming it into a general data structure.
- **API Usage**: Utilizing the Google Sheets API to store and process data, as well as the Telegram API to send alerts about interesting data and runtime statuses such as script errors.

**Note**: Many of the techniques and strategies demonstrated here remain effective in 2025, reflecting their adaptability and resilience.

## Project List
1. **Odds Notifier**: A project for scraping odds (specifically team and total shots in the top 5 soccer leagues) from sportsbooks. Finalized February 2024.
