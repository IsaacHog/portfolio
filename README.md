# Portfolio - Sports Betting

Welcome to my portfolio, showcasing scripts and demo projects I developed for sports betting between **2022** and **2024**.

## Overview

This repository highlights my work on:
- **Reverse Engineering Sportsbooks**: Analyzing and adapting sportsbook platforms.
- **Browserless Requests**: Creating scripts to interact with websites efficiently without the use of browsers.
- **Anti-Bot Detection**: Developing innovative methods to circumvent anti-bot mechanisms implemented by sportsbooks and popular third-party protections such as Cloudflare.
- **Data Engineering**: Handling data from multiple sportsbooks, each following its own unique structure, and transforming it into a general data structure.
- **API Usage**: Utilizing the Google Sheets API to store and process data, as well as the Telegram API to send alerts about interesting data and runtime statuses such as script errors.

**Note**: Many of the techniques and strategies demonstrated here remain effective in 2025, reflecting their adaptability and resilience.

## Project List
1. **Odds Notifier**: A project for scraping odds (specifically team and total shots in the top 5 soccer leagues) from sportsbooks. Finalized February 2024.
