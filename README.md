# Portfolio - Sports Betting

Welcome to my portfolio, where I present scripts and demo projects developed for sports betting between **2022** and **2024**.  

## About Me  
I am currently pursuing a **Data Scientist** degree at EC-Utbildning (2024–2026), focusing on statistical data analysis, machine learning, SQL, Power BI and R programming.
Prior to this, I completed a **Software Development** engineering course at NTI-Gymnasiet (2022–2023), where I honed my skills in React, Git, SCRUM and Python.

In addition to my academic journey, I founded and managed a team of 8 people focused on identifying and leveraging software mistakes in sportsbooks from 2021 to 2024. I developed software and databases to handle and execute bets effectively, applying my knowledge in automation and statistical analysis.  

## My Software Development Journey in Sportsbetting
Over the course of these 3 years, I have continually evolved in crafting software solutions, striving for greater efficiency and cleaner code. Reflecting on my journey through approximately 20 projects, there has been a noticeable progression in code quality. Initially, my scripts were large and unwieldy; however, they gradually transformed into more modular structures and ultimately culminated in efficient algorithms.  

This repository is dedicated to showcasing only the most well-crafted and impactful projects from that journey in terms of programming.

## Overview  

This repository highlights my work on:  
- **Reverse Engineering Sportsbooks**: Analyzing and adapting sportsbook platforms.  
- **Browserless Requests**: Creating scripts to interact with websites efficiently without the use of browsers.  
- **Anti-Bot Detection**: Developing innovative methods to circumvent anti-bot mechanisms implemented by sportsbooks and popular third-party protections such as Cloudflare.  
- **Data Engineering**: Handling data from multiple sportsbooks, each following its own unique structure, and transforming it into a general data structure.  
- **API Usage**: Utilizing the Google Sheets API to store and process data, as well as the Telegram API to send alerts about interesting data and runtime statuses such as script errors.  

**Note**: Many of the techniques and strategies demonstrated here remain effective in 2025, reflecting their adaptability and resilience.

## Project List  
1. **Odds Notifier**: A project for scraping odds (specifically team and total shots in the top 5 soccer leagues) from sportsbooks. Finalized February 2024.

Notable projects not yet listed in detail:
- **Auto bettor bot**: Created an automated bot to place bets seamlessly across 8 different sportsbooks.
- **Sportsbook Scraping Scripts**: Developed robust scripts for scraping data from 8+ different sportsbooks, utilizing reverse engineering techniques.
- **Live Betting Models**: Designed two simple models for live betting on soccer and tennis in smaller leagues, effectively exploiting overfitted live-odds algorithms on specific sportsbooks.
- **Odds Screen GUI**: Built a google sheets GUI to monitor and set alerts for odds thresholds across 6 different sportsbooks.
- **5-Card Poker Automated Bot**: Created an automated bot for 5-card poker to meet casino bonus wagering requirements with minimal expected loss.
