# Portfolio - Sports Betting

Welcome to my portfolio, showcasing scripts and demo projects I developed for sports betting between **2022** and **2024**.

## Overview

This repository highlights my work on:
- **Reverse Engineering Sportsbooks**: Analyzing and adapting sportsbook platforms.
- **Browserless Requests**: Crafting scripts to interact with websites efficiently without the use of browsers.
- **Anti-Bot Detection**: Developing innovative methods to circumvent anti-bot mechanisms implemented by sportsbooks and popular third-party protection like Cloudflare.

**Note**: Many of the techniques and strategies demonstrated here remain effective in 2025, reflecting their adaptability and resilience.

## Project List
1. **Card Screen**: A project for scraping odds (specifically bookings in the top 5 soccer leagues) from different sportsbooks. Finalized december 2023.
